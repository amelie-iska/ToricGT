# Parameter-Golf Adaptation

The Parameter-Golf track is a compatibility layer, not a replacement for the
research graph model. The goal is to keep the ToricGT inductive biases that fit
inside the OpenAI Model Craft Challenge constraints with minimal invasive
changes.

## Defaults

- Architecture: dense random-order autoregressive byte model.
- Artifact target: `15,600,000` bytes, leaving margin under the `16,000,000`
  decimal-byte challenge cap.
- Stored size: 7 dense blocks at width 384, recurrently applied twice.
- Attention: hybrid lower softmax and upper tropical-ring attention.
- Toric features: fixed sine/cosine phase channels on target positions.
- Order policy: content-independent random permutation per byte chunk/sample.
- Soft-MoE: off for the contest track; still default for the graph research
  encoder.
- PolarQuant: optional 8-bit KV perturbation in evaluation/export checks.

## Why Random-Order AR

A byte chunk is treated as a small ordered graph whose target nodes are byte
positions. A random permutation chooses the order in which positions are
revealed. At step `k`, the model sees only BOS and the tokens revealed at steps
`< k`, plus the current target position. It does not see the token being scored
or any later revealed token. This is the score-before-update rule:

```text
previous_tokens[k] = BOS                         if k = 0
previous_tokens[k] = target_tokens[k - 1]        otherwise
target_tokens[k]  = bytes[permutation[k]]
```

The permutation seed is derived from the run seed, sample id, pass id, and
length. It is independent of byte content, so it cannot leak validation bytes.

## Commands

Train:

```bash
conda run --no-capture-output -n tokengt env PYTHONPATH=src \
  python scripts/train_parameter_golf_random_order.py \
  --config config/train.parameter_golf_random_order_dense.yaml
```

Export:

```bash
conda run -n tokengt env PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/export_parameter_golf_artifact.py \
  --checkpoint checkpoints/parameter_golf_random_order_dense/best.pt \
  --output outputs/parameter_golf/toricgt_artifact.zip \
  --bits 8
```

Smoke test:

```bash
conda run --no-capture-output -n tokengt env PYTHONPATH=src \
  python scripts/train_parameter_golf_random_order.py \
  --synthetic --steps 2 --batch-size 2 --grad-accum-steps 1 \
  --seq-len 32 --d-model 32 --num-heads 4 --num-layers 1 \
  --recurrent-passes 1 --device cpu --precision fp32 --no-wandb
```

## Compliance Notes

- The training script does not read validation rows during optimization.
- Evaluation derives fresh content-independent random orders for each batch.
- The artifact audit runs before training and fails if the compressed export is
  above the challenge cap.
- `keys.txt`, checkpoints, and logs are not intended for git commits.
